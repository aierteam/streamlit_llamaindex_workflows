Decision: Accept — applicant meets the GPA requirement.

Justification:
- The official transcript provided shows a cumulative GPA of 3.02 (Qpts 57.50), which is above the 3.0 threshold.
- Supporting materials (resume, recommendation letters) further indicate strong recent academic performance and strong clinical/research experience; the resume lists an even higher current GPA (3.85), suggesting an upward trend.
- Recommendation: verify the final/most recent official transcript and resolve minor institution/name inconsistencies before issuing a final offer.
