Decision: Accept

Justification: The applicant meets the stated admissions requirement—her transcript shows a cumulative GPA of 3.02 (Fall 2020), which is above the 3.0 threshold. Supplementary materials (resume and strong letters of recommendation) further support academic strength, research experience, clinical exposure, and professionalism. Recommend admission pending standard verification of official transcripts and routine checks.
